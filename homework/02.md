 Due | Monday, September 12 &#64; 3:00 PM
:--- | :---
What: | Use the 2D drawing functions in [p5.js](https://p5js.org) to create an original code-based drawing.
How to Submit: | Copy and paste your p5.js code into the body of an email to your instructor and TA.


## Details
Your second homework assignment asks you to create an original drawing created entirely by javascript code.   [p5.js](https://p5js.org), the javascript library based on [Processing](http://processing.org), has a built-in set of functions for generating [2D shape primitives](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Shape).  Explore these and the [color functions](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Color) to produce your sketch.


## Tips

Set up your drawing canvas inside the curly brackets of the [`function setup()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/setup) function:

1. Use the [`createCanvas()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createCanvas) function to establish the dimensions of your canvas by passing `width` and `height` parameters in pixels.  The default `P2D` renderer can be used so that parameter can be left out of the `createCanvas` function call.  

2.  Use the [`background()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/background) function to set the background color for your canvas.

Once you have your drawing canvas set up, you can add the lines of code that will execute your drawing inside the curly brackets of the `function draw()` function.

1.  Use the 2d drawing functions in p5.js to create the points, lines, and shapes that constitute the forms in your drawing.  These may include:

    * Points: [`point()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/point)

    * Lines:  [`line()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/line)

    * Ellipses/Circles: [`ellipse()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ellipse)

    * Rectangles/Squares:  [`rect()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/rect)

    * Triangles:  [`triangle()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/triangle)

    * Quadrilaterals:  [`quad()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/quad)

    * Arcs: [`arc()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/arc)

    * If you are ambitious, you could try your hand at *curves* using the [`bezier()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/bezier) and [`curve()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/curve) functions and/or complex compound shapes using the [`beginShape()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/beginShape) functions.   Shapes with negative space can be created using the [`beginContour()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/beginContour) function.

2.  Points & Lines - Use the [`stroke()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/stroke) function to set the color of points and lines, and the [`strokeWeight()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/strokeWeight) function to set the thickness of points and lines.

3.  Shapes - Use the [`fill()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/fill) function to set the color of shapes.   The [`stroke()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/stroke) function can be used to set the color of a shape's border, or the [`noStroke()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noStroke) can be used to draw a shape without a border.  

**Special Note**:  The code in p5.js executes sequentially, from top to bottom, so shape functions added later in your code will be drawn *on top of* shape functions called earlier/higher in your code.  Additionally, stroke and fill functions should be written *before* a shape function is called.
