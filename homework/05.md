What: | Work through Exercises 1 - 6 in the SIK Guide (pp. 1 - 43) and brainstorm your midterm project idea with your partner.
How to Submit: | Post your midterm project idea as your .zipcrit for week &#35;4.


## Details
Your 5th homework assignment is to read pp. 1 - 43 in the SIK Guide and complete exercises 1 - 6 using the [Sparkfun Redboard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12757) (the Arduino Uno-based microcontroller in your Inventor's kit).  Take the time to wire up each exercise using the components in the kit.  Code can be explored and uploaded to the Redboard using the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).  The Arduino IDE is similar to the p5 IDE, except that Arduino is based on C/C++ code, not javascript.

While similar to javascript, Arduino's C/C++ is a *typed language*, so you'll notice that Arduino requires you to declare the *type* of variable, not just that something is a variable.  For example, if javascript allows you to declare `var x=0;` or `var p = "watermelon"` as generic variables (`var`), in Arduino you need to specify that `x` is an integer and that `p` is a string, like this:
```c++
int x = 0;
char p = "watermelon";
```
As you work through exercises 1 - 6, collaborate with your partner to define your midterm project and submit your project proposal as this week's .zipcrit.  

## Redboard Integration with P5js
Toward the end of last class, we switched from using the Arduino IDE to interfacing with the Sparkfun Redboard through [p5js](http://p5js.org/).  

In order to make that integration functional, several steps are necessary:

### Part I - Installation of Firmata, Node and p5bots-server

1.  Load the `StandardFirmata` library onto your Redboard.  This enables p5js to exchange commands with the microcontroller using the [firmata protocol](https://github.com/firmata/protocol).  In other words, with firmata loaded onto your microcontroller, you can write your code directly in p5js and don't have to load anything additional onto the Redboard.  To load onto your Redboard, follow these steps:  

    * In the Arduino IDE, choose File > Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmata from the main menu to open the library.  

    * Verify and upload the library to your Redboard.

    * Write down the port name that the Arduino IDE is using to connect to your Redboard (e.g. `/dev/cu.usbserial-DA00WYS6`).

2.  Next, check to see if [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on the computer you are using:  

    * Launch the Terminal application (in OS X).  

    * At the command prompt $, type `node -v`  

    * The command prompt should return a version # (e.g. `v6.3.0`).   If it does, you can skip to step 3.

    * If you instead receive an error, you will need to [install node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/).  

3.  There is a Node.js package that has been written to enable communication between p5js and the Redboard, [p5bots](https://github.com/sarahgp/p5bots).  To install, follow these steps:  

    * At the command prompt $, type `npm install -g p5bots-server`

    * If you have administrative rights on your computer, the package should install without errors.  

    * If, on the other hand, you do NOT have administrative rights (and this would apply to the lab computers), you have to install the p5bots package locally, using this command at the command prompt $ instead: `npm install p5bots-server`.  

    * Test the installation of the p5bots server by typing at the command prompt $: `bots-go` if you have admin rights, or, if you do not, type:
    ```shell
       node ./node_modules/.bin/bots-go

       // replace XX with your OS X username
    ```
    If installed correctly, you should see this indication:  `server starting`

    * Press control-c to stop the server.

### Part II - Modifications to the p5.js index.html file

Now that you have `StandardFirmata` loaded onto your Redboard, confirmed that Node.js is installed on your computer, and installed the p5bots-server package, you can now launch the p5js IDE application and make necessary modifications to the index.html file.  In addition to the p5.js library and the p5.dom.js library, we need to add the socket.io and p5bots.js libraries to our index.html.

1. Launch the p5js IDE.

2. In the left-hand sidebar, click on the index.html file to open it in the IDE.   If the sidebar is not visible, enable it in the Preferences by clicking on the cogwheel icon and setting "Show Sidebar" to `on`.

3. In line 5 of the index.html file, you can change the contents of the `<title>` tag of the document from "Untitled" to something more descriptive, such as "My First p5bots Sketch"

4. Then, at line 10, add these two lines of code:  
```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/1.4.8/socket.io.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarahgp/p5bots/master/examples/p5_scripts/p5bots.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
Alternatively, you can download the two javascript files and add them to your p5 project's `libraries` directory and link to them by a relative `src` attribute:  
```html
<script src="libraries/socket.io.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="libraries/p5bots.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

5.  Choose File > Save As from the main menu to save your modified project to your Desktop.  

### Part III - sketch.js ###

Now open the `sketch.js` file in your p5 project.  The following code will draw a circle in the center of the canvas that, when clicked, will turn on an LED that has been wired into digital pin 9 of the Redboard.

![Fritzing Wiring Diagram - Arduino Pin 9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarahgp/p5bots/master/examples/diagrams/led.png)

```javascript
// Board setup — you will need to change the port!
var b = p5.board('/dev/cu.usbserial-XXXXX', 'arduino');

var ledPin;  
// create a variable to hold a reference to the pin to which the LED is attached.

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  noStroke();
  fill(62, 0, 255);
  ellipse(width/2, height/2, 100, 100); // draw ellipse
  ledPin = b.pin(9, 'DIGITAL', 'OUTPUT'); // assign pin 9 to ledPin variable, set mode as digital output
}

function mousePressed() {
  var d = dist(width/2, height/2, mouseX, mouseY);  //collision detection with ellipse
  if (d < 100) {
    ledPin.write('HIGH');  // turn LED on
  }
}

function mouseReleased() {
  ledPin.write('LOW');  // turn LED off
}
```

Save your project!

### Part IV - Launching your Project ###

Usually we can use the play button in the p5 IDE to launch a simple node-based webserver to view our project.  However, we want to launch our projects with the `p5bots-server` instead.

1. Return to your Terminal.app.

2.  Launch the `p5bots-server` in the terminal, with reference to your p5 project folder:

    * If you were able to install and run `bots-go` as an administrator, you can run your project by entering this at the command prompt $:  
    ```
    bots-go -d /full/path/to/your/p5/project/
    ```
    If your project folder is called `hello-p5bots`, then your full path would be `/Users/XX/Desktop/hello-p5bots` where `XX` is your OS X username.

    * If on the other hand you do NOT have admin rights, you can run your project by entering this at the command prompt $:  
    ```
    node ./node_modules/.bin/bots-go -d /full/path/to/your/p5/project/
    ```
3.  You should see `server starting` in your Terminal window.

4.  Make sure your Redboard is connected to your computer via USB.   Open a browser and go to http://locahost:8000

5.  You should see purple ellipse on the page, which, when clicked, turns the pin 9 LED on your Redboard on and off.

## P5js Equivalents to the SIK Guide Exercise Code ##

This section contains p5js/p5bots code equivalents for each of the Arduino exercises in the SIK Guide.

### Exercise 1:  Blinking an LED ###

**Option 1: Digital Write with `setInterval()`**
```javascript
// replace with your board's port
var b = p5.board('/dev/cu.usbserial-DA00WYS6', 'arduino');

var ledPin;

function setup() {
    ledPin = b.pin(13, 'DIGITAL', 'OUTPUT');  // set pin 13 to Digital Output mode
    setInterval(function(){ledPin.write('HIGH');}, 1000);
    setInterval(function(){ledPin.write('LOW');}, 2000);
}

function draw(){

}
```


**Option 2:  Using the p5bot special [`LED methods`](https://github.com/sarahgp/p5bots/blob/master/src/client/README.md#led-methods)**
```javascript
// replace with your board's port
var b = p5.board('/dev/cu.usbserial-DA00WYS6', 'arduino');

var ledPin;

function setup() {

  ledPin = b.pin(13, 'LED'); // set pin 13 to LED mode
  ledPin.blink(1000); // led.blink(duration);
}

function draw(){

}
```

### Exercise 2 - Potentiometer ###


In this example, the potentiometer (pin A0) controls the brightness of the LED (pin 11):
```javascript
// replace with your board's port
var b = p5.board('/dev/cu.usbserial-DA00WVK6', 'arduino');

var sensorPin;

var ledPin;
var bright;

function setup() {
  ledPin = b.pin(11, 'PWM', 'OUTPUT');  // set pin 11 to PWM mode

  sensorPin = b.pin(0, 'ANALOG', 'INPUT');  // set pin A0 to Analog Input mode
  sensorPin.read(function(){
    bright = round(map(sensorPin.val, 0, 1023, 0, 255)); // map potentiometer values to led brightness
    console.log(bright);

  });
 // setInterval(function(){ledPin.blink(sensorPin.val);}), 1000);
  createCanvas(200,200);

}

function draw(){
    background(255);
    text("value: " + bright, 10, 10);
    ledPin.write(bright);
}
```
