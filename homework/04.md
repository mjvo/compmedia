This is an extension of [John Kuiphoff's Simple Drawing Application](http://coursescript.com/notes/interactivecomputing/drawingapp/) assignment.
## Details
Your 4th homework assignment is to create a simple drawing application in [p5js](http://p5js.org).   The application should make use of what you've learned about 2D drawing in p5js as well as use DOM elements (sliders, drop-down boxes, etc.) as user interface elements.

At minimum, the application should possess the following capabilities:
* The user should be able to **draw on the canvas** using the click-and-drag function of the mouse.
* The user should be able to change the **line thickness** through a control slider in the user interface.
* The user should be able to change the **color** of the line through a control in the user interface (e.g. a drop-down box or set of sliders).
* The user should be able to switch between line-drawing mode and **image-stamp mode** through a radio-button control set in the user interface.  In image-stamp mode, clicking on the canvas should place a small image at the location of the mouse-click.
* The user should be able to **clear the canvas** by pressing the SPACEBAR.  
(Hint: trigger a `background()` draw with the [`keyPressed()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/keyPressed)) function evaluating the [`keyCode`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/keyCode) variable.)
* Use HTML elements or the p5js `text()` function to **label** your controls (e.g. there should be a label "line thickness" on the slider that controls it.)

Beyond this baseline functionality, feel free to exercise creative license.

## Useful Code Snippets

### Basic Drawing ###

The following code will draw a continuous freeform line when the mouse is click-and-dragged on the canvas.
```
    function mouseDragged() {
	       line(mouseX, mouseY, pmouseX, pmouseY);
    }
```
But you don't need to use a solid line.  The following code produces a "scatter" of points.
```
    // global variable defined at top of sketch
    var scatterDistance = 10; // scatter distance from mouse

    function mouseDragged(){
        for(var i=0; i<50;i++){
            point(mouseX+random(scatterDistance),mouseY+random(scatterDistance));
        }
```
or you can use shape primitives, a scatter of lines, etc to create different drawing brushes.

### User Interface DOM Controls ###

The [p5js DOM library](http://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.dom) provides some useful functions that enable you to create DOM elements (sliders, drop-down select elements, radio buttons) that can be used as user interface elements in your drawing application.  These can be used to control color, line thickness, and drawing mode (stamp versus line).

**Sliders**

The [`createSlider()`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createSlider) function adds an HTML slider element to the page.  It can be positioned inside or outside the canvas.  Manipulating the slider changes its value, which can be made available to your sketch by attaching a `.value()` method to the slider and assigning it to a variable.
```
    var mySlider;

    function setup(){
        createCanvas(200,200);
        // createSlider(min,max,[value],[step])
        mySlider = createSlider(1,10,1);
        mySlider.position(10,10);
    }

    function draw(){
        background(255);
        var myValue = mySlider.value();
        text("Value: "+ myValue, 10, 40);
    }
```

**Drop-Down Selectors**  

The [`createSelect`](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createSelect) function adds a drop-down box (HTML `<select>` input element) to the page.  A function can be attached to the `.change()` method of the drop-down box.  Like the slider above, the `.value()` method makes the selected value of the drop-down available to the sketch.

```
    var backgroundSelect;

    function setup(){
        createCanvas(200,200);
        backgroundSelect = createSelect();
        backgroundSelect.position(10,10);
        backgroundSelect.option("white");
        backgroundSelect.option("red");
        backgroundSelect.option("yellow", "rgb(255,255,0)")
        backgroundSelect.changed(changeBackground);
    }

    function changeBackground(){
        var backColor = backgroundSelect.value();
        background(backColor);
    }
```

**Radio Buttons**  

The ['createRadio()'](http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createRadio) function creates a radio button element.  You can set one of the radio buttons options to "checked" by using the `.checked = true` method.


```
    var drawSelect; // variable for the radio buttons
    var drawMode; // variable for the radio button value

    function setup() {
        createCanvas(400,400);
        drawSelect = createRadio();
        drawSelect.option('Free Form Line', 'line').checked = true;
        drawSelect.option('Random Circle', 'circle');
    }

    function draw(){
        // poll the value of the radio button
        drawMode = drawSelect.value();
    }

    function mouseDragged(){
        if (drawMode == 'line'){
            line(mouseX, mouseY, pmouseX, pmouseY);
        }

        if (drawMode == 'circle'){
            var diameter = random(50);
            ellipse(mouseX,mouseY,diameter,diameter)
        }
    }
```
