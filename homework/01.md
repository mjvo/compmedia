What: | Create an online profile introducing yourself to the class.
How to Submit: | Email your instructor and TA the URL to your http://people.duke.edu/~netid page.

## Details
For this initial homework assignment, you will use HTML markup and CSS styling to create an online profile webpage, introducing yourself to the class.  The goal is to familiarize yourself with basic HTML and CSS syntax, and to begin to understand how HTML and CSS translate into visual representations when viewed in a browser.   

The only software you need for this assignment is a [plain-text text editor](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_editors.asp) and an internet connection for uploading your files to a server.  

If you like to try out a more advanced coding environment, consider the [free Atom editor from Github](https://atom.io/).

**Content Requirements**

*At minimum*, your profile should include:
* Your name as page title (`<title>`) and main heading (`<h1>`)

* A paragraph or more of information about your background and current plans, with hyperlinks to other pages (e.g. the homepage of your graduate program)

* A list of your main interests

* A photograph or other image that represents you.  


**Markup Requirements**

Name your HTML file `index.html`

Your HTML file should include:
* HTML5 syntax (`!DOCTYPE` declaration, appropriately nested `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>` tags)  
[See http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp for a concise explanation.]

* Appropriate use of HTML markup to indicate content hierarchies (e.g. content organized into headings, subheadings, paragraphs, lists, etc).

* Image tags (`<img>`) should contain an `alt`, `height`, and `width` attributes [see http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp).]

* Your profile image `src` attribute may point to an external image URL, or point to a file that is stored locally relative to the index.html file (either in the same directory, or in a subdirectory)

Your CSS can *either* be included in the `<head>` of your document, or as an externally linked `style.css` file.  You can use CSS to style the look and feel of your HTML markup, including:
* the [background](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp) of your page,

* the text [color](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_color.asp) and [formatting](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_text.asp),

* the link [colors and formatting](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp),

* and, for the adventurous, [page layout](http://learnlayout.com/toc.html) and [much more](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_examples.asp)!


### Publishing Your `index.html` file

Duke [provides all faculty, staff, and students](http://oit.duke.edu/comp-print/storage/homedir/cifs.php) with their own static HTML server space, accessible through the CIFS protocol.   

You can upload your `index.html`, `style.css` and image files to the `public_html` folder in your personal space on this server.   They will then be accessible via the internet at http://people.duke.edu/~yourNetID

**Connection Instructions**

To connect to your CIFS home directory, your computer needs to be connected to the Duke network. If you are unable to connect to the Duke network (e.g. you are working off-campus), connect via Duke's [Virtual Private Network (VPN)](https://portal.duke.edu/+CSCOE+/logon.html).   

__*OS X - Step by Step:*__

1.	Click on the Finder.

2.	From the Go menu, choose Connect to Server...  

3.  A dialog box will appear.

4.	In it, type `cifs://homedir.oit.duke.edu/users/n/netid` where `n` is the first letter of your NetID, and `netid` is your NetID.<br /><br />
Example: for the NetID `hiro`, type `cifs://homedir.oit.duke.edu/users/h/hiro`

5.	Press the Connect button.

6.	A login dialog appears.

7. 	Log in with your NetID and NetID password.  
<br />The Connecting to Server progress bar will appear. When the connection is made, a Finder window opens and displays your CIFS home directory folder (indicated by your NetID).

8.  Locate the folder in your CIFS home directory called `public_html`.  Copy your `index.html`, `style.css`, and any image files/folders into the `public_html` folder.

9.  Visit http://people.duke.edu/~yourNetID to view your webpage!

__*Windows - Step by Step:*__

1.	Select Start > Computer (for Windows 8, select WIN+F > Apps > Computer).

2.	In the Computer window, click Map Network Drive (on the top toolbar). The Map Network Drive dialog box appears.

3.	In the Drive list, select an available drive letter.

4.	In the Folder box, type `\\homedir.oit.duke.edu\users\n\netid` where `n` is the first letter of your NetID, and `netid` is your NetID.
<br /><br />
Example: for the NetID `hiro`, type `cifs://homedir.oit.duke.edu/users/h/hiro`

5.	Click to select the "Connect using different credentials" check box.

6.	Click Finish. The Windows Security dialog box appears.

7.	In the User name box, type `win\` followed by your NetID.  
Example: `win\hiro`.

8.	In the Password box, type your NetID password.

9.	Click OK.
<br />The Windows Security and Map Network Drive dialog boxes close, and your home directory is displayed.

10. Locate the folder in your CIFS home directory called `public_html`.

11.  Copy your `index.html`, `style.css`, and any image files/folders into the `public_html` folder.
